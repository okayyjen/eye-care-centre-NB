      "title1":"MANAGING THE SYMPTOMS AND SIDE EFFECTS OF GLAUCOMA",
      "text1":"Glaucoma is an eye disease characterized by damage to the optic nerve, which is the nerve that transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. It is usually caused by fluid buildup in the front portion of the eye which creates pressure in the eye and damages the nerve. Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness for people over the age of 60, and any vision lost to glaucoma cannot be recovered. However, with early diagnosis and intervention, treatment can prevent vision loss and blindness. There are several different kinds of glaucoma and treatment depends on the specific type and severity. The primary goal of treatment is to lower or control the intraocular pressure, or pressure in the eye, which threatens the optic nerve.",
      "title2":"MEDICATED EYEDROPS",
      "text2":"One of the first lines of defense against glaucoma is usually the use of medicated eye drops. Eye drops can either reduce the amount of fluid created in the eye or improve the flow of fluid out of the eye. For example, certain medicated eye drops contain prostaglandins — drugs that improve the non-conventional flow of fluids out of the eye, thereby reducing intraocular pressure. Other drugs are alphaadrenergic agonists or beta-blockers, both of which decrease the fluid production in the eye. These eye drops may be prescribed alone or in combination with each other. Like any medication, medicated eye drops are not prescribed to individuals that have certain medical conditions or health concerns. For some individuals, eye drops placed in the eye could be absorbed by the blood vessels in the nasal mucosa and may affect heart rate and breathing. In rare cases, some eye drops can compromise health and exacerbate certain conditions like asthma. For this reason, all candidates are carefully evaluated and their detailed medical history is recorded before the doctor prescribes medicated eye drops.",
      "title3":"SURGERY CAN MANAGE GLAUCOMA",
      "text3":"If medicated eye drops fail to adequately treat glaucoma or if they cause undesirable side effects, surgery is another treatment option. Surgery is designed to improve the flow of fluids out of the eye to help lower intraocular pressure. A procedure called laser trabeculoplasty uses a laser to stimulate the eye’s drainage system to work more efficiently. This relieves some of the pressure in the eye. Laser iridotomy is another procedure in which a tiny hole is made through the eye’s iris to improve the flow of the fluid in the eye. Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS) is a newer procedure where stents are implanted to help drain fluid from your eye. In a trabeculectomy, a flap is created in the white of the eye (the sclera) and an opening is made in the eye to release built-up fluid. These procedures may be combined with the use of medicated eye drops for the best results.",

For our patients, it can be scary, bothersome, and inconvenient to lose their vision from cataracts. Cataracts have a significant impact on lifestyle, independence, and mobility. Our eye doctors are committed to offering effective treatment options and delivering great patient care. We believe in educating patients so they can make informed decisions about their treatment. Our patients are treated with respect, compassion, and patience throughout the entire experience. If you are progressively losing your vision due to cataracts, and it is becoming increasingly harder to perform everyday tasks — such as driving or reading the label on a bottle of medicine — we invite you to schedule a free consultation with our cataract specialists. We can explain why your vision is worsening and what we can do about it.",
      "title2":"HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE CATARACTS?",
      "text2":"Cataracts are diagnosed after an eye exam with one of our doctors or an optometrist. You may have cataracts if you: • Are over the age of 60 • Notice your vision is progressively worsening• Have cloudy or blurry vision • Need frequent prescription changes in your eyeglasses or contact lenses • See glare around headlights, lamps, or sunlight • Have poor night vision • Have double vision or multiple images • Notice that colours seem faded or “washed out”",
      "title3":"HOW CATARACT SURGERY WORKS",
      "text3":"If your cataracts progress to the point where they interfere with your vision and make it difficult to perform everyday tasks, surgical treatment is the best choice. If left untreated, poor vision may lead to motor vehicle accidents, falls, and other accidents to the patient or others. Cataract surgery involves removing the clouded, cataract-diseased lens and replacing it with an artificial lens implant (an intraocular lens or IOL). The most common surgery performed in the world, cataract surgery is extremely safe and effective. Complications are rare. There are different lenses to suit different lifestyles. Some lenses are designed to work best for near vision; others for distance vision. Special lenses have the ability to adjust for both near and distance vision. Other lenses are intended to correct astigmatism. For example, if you spend a lot of time reading or sewing, you may opt for a different lens than someone who spends a lot of time driving or playing sports. Our eye doctors and cataract consultants will help you select the best lens package for your lifestyle.",
      "title4":"WHAT TO EXPECT",
      "text4":"Prior to cataract surgery, several tests will be performed to determine the most suitable type of intraocular lens package for your lifestyle. We specialize in many types of new, high-technology lenses that allow for clear vision for distance, near, or both, even without glasses or contact lenses. Once your surgery date has been scheduled, you will receive comprehensive instructions and a prescription for medicated eye drops. We recommend starting the eye drops two days before your cataract surgery. On the day of surgery, you will need to arrange for someone to drive you to and from surgery. Please plan on being here for several hours. You will be awake during surgery but you will not be able to see the surgery being performed. If you are nervous, we have medication you can take prior to the surgery to relax you. The procedure takes 8 – 15 minutes and goes by very quickly. It is not painful but there is a sensation of pressure and water. After surgery, we will place a clear, plastic protective patch over your eye. Both eyes are generally done on separate days.",
      "title5":"LIFE AFTER CATARACT SURGERY",
      "text5":"Cataract surgery is designed to give you clearer and more colourful vision (sort of like the vision you enjoyed in your youth). Driving and reading become easier. High-definition vision makes the details of your surroundings stand out. Your dependence on corrective glasses may change depending on your lens choice — you may only need glasses for reading, or possibly not at all. For many people, improved vision correlates with better self-confidence, improved mental health, more independence, and a reduction in falls. Hobbies, activities, and social outings become more enjoyable. Overall quality of life increases. There is no age limit for cataract surgery. Anyone with cataracts can enjoy the benefits of cataract surgery regardless of their age.",
